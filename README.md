### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process
  Designed mobile first. Using HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

  I first looked at the design documents, then I planned out the HTML structure. Did the styling with css, which was pretty annoying tbh, then did the javascript. I followed the w3schools tutorial on how to make a slideshow and implemented it into my own javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

  I reinforced my knowledge of the DOM with this project.

### Continued development

  I plan to do more projects like this to solidify my knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Slideshow](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) - This helped me with writing out the code for the slideshow.
